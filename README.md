# Flashcards
This project is a web application that enables users to create multiple sets of flashcards to aid in their studies. It is written using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap) and JavaScript (Vanilla). Data is kept in localStorage, allowing users to use this app without an internet connection. 

Motivation
===
Flashcards are an effective tool for memorizing large amounts of information in a short amount of time. Instead of tediouslly writing down hundreds of terms and definitions on paper, users will be able to digitally organize their study sets in a easy to manage format without requiring an internet connection. 

This project is set to serve as one of many widgets in a larger web-application named "ToDo", which is a project aimed at creating a online tool designed to help students manage their time, and build effective studying habits. This is my second project done using HTML5,CSS and JavaScript, I've learned alot about front-end
